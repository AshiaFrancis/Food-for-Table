        <hr>
        <div class="ourpurpose">
        <p1> Originating in the local town of Norcross, Food for Table started with <br>
            one girl, and a desire to share all of her favorite restaurants with her <br>
            community. Ashia Francis, the creator of Food for Table, started out <br>
            with just an idea: What if we gave our community a way to view places they <br>
            would have never been? And so, Food for Table was born. As the years have<br>
            gone by, our purpose has become more focused on helping the Atlanta community<br>
            discover family owned restaurants and hidden gems, all over the Metro <br>
            Atlanta area.
